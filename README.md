# AI CV Maker Application

This project is a modern landing page for an AI-powered CV Maker. Users can input a job title or description to get a tailored CV outline generated by AI.

## Key Features

*   AI-powered CV outline generation.
*   Responsive design with Tailwind CSS.
*   Interactive UI built with React.
*   Supports two conceptual approaches:
    1.  **Frontend-Only Direct API Call (Default):** Calls Google Gemini API directly from the frontend.
    2.  **Frontend with Simulated Backend:** Frontend calls a simulated backend, which would handle the API interaction (backend code is currently commented out, available for later development).

## Running the Application (Frontend)

1.  Ensure you have a modern web browser that supports ES modules and import maps.
2.  Open `index.html` directly in your browser.
3.  No build step is strictly necessary for the frontend to operate as is for basic viewing.

**API Key (`process.env.API_KEY`) is CRUCIAL:**
*   The application **defaults to Direct API Calls** (`generateCVContentDirect`). For this to work, the `API_KEY` must be available as `process.env.API_KEY` in the frontend's JavaScript environment.
*   This typically requires a build process (e.g., using Vite, Webpack with `DefinePlugin` or `dotenv-webpack`) to substitute `process.env.API_KEY` with an actual key. **Never hardcode your API key directly in client-side source code committed to a repository.**
*   For local testing without a build setup, you might temporarily define `window.process = { env: { API_KEY: "YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_HERE" } };` in the browser console *before* the application scripts run. However, this is not secure or scalable for anything beyond brief local testing.
*   If you switch to the **Simulated Backend** approach later (by modifying `HeroSection.tsx` to call `generateCVContent` and running `server/main.js`), the server code will expect `API_KEY` to be set as an environment variable in the Node.js environment (e.g., via a `.env` file loaded with `dotenv`).

## Conceptual Codebases: Direct API vs. Simulated Backend

This project is structured to demonstrate two common ways to integrate with services like the Gemini API:

### 1. Frontend-Only (Direct API Call) - Default Behavior
*   **Logic:** The frontend JavaScript makes API calls directly to the Google Gemini service.
*   **Service Function:** `services/geminiService.ts` contains `generateCVContentDirect(jobInfo: string): Promise<string>`.
*   **Current Usage:** `components/HeroSection.tsx` calls `generateCVContentDirect` by default.
*   **Pros:** Simpler initial setup for small projects or prototypes if API key management is handled securely.
*   **Cons:** Exposing API call patterns and potentially API keys (if not handled very carefully via a secure proxy or build-time replacement) on the client-side can be a security risk. API key handling is more complex to do securely without a backend proxy.
*   **API Key:** Requires `process.env.API_KEY` to be available in the browser's JavaScript context.

### 2. Frontend with Simulated Backend (For Later Development)
*   **Logic:** The frontend JavaScript makes a request to a local backend endpoint (e.g., `/api/cv/generate`). This backend (simulated in `server/main.js`) would then make the actual call to the Google Gemini service.
*   **Service Function (Frontend):** `services/geminiService.ts` contains `generateCVContent(jobInfo: string): Promise<string>`.
*   **Simulated Backend File:** `server/main.js` (currently all code is commented out).
*   **Pros:** More secure, as API keys are kept on the server. Allows for more complex backend logic, caching, rate limiting, database interaction, etc. This is the recommended approach for production applications.
*   **Cons:** Requires running a separate backend server.
*   **API Key:** The backend server (`server/main.js` when active) would need `process.env.API_KEY`.

### Switching Between Approaches in `HeroSection.tsx`

By default, `components/HeroSection.tsx` uses `generateCVContentDirect` (direct frontend API call). If you want to work on or test the **simulated backend** integration:

1.  Open `components/HeroSection.tsx`.
2.  Locate the `handleCreateCV` function.
3.  Modify the API call:
    *   Comment out or change the line:
        ```typescript
        const result = await generateCVContentDirect(jobInfo); 
        ```
    *   To:
        ```typescript
        const result = await generateCVContent(jobInfo);
        ```
4.  Ensure `generateCVContent` is imported at the top of `HeroSection.tsx` (it already is if you used the provided code).
    ```typescript
    import { generateCVContentDirect, generateCVContent } from '../services/geminiService';
    ```
5.  You would then need to uncomment and run the backend code in `server/main.js` (and set up its `API_KEY` environment variable) for this path to function.

## Update Instructions & Changelog

### Default to Direct Frontend API Calls (Current Version)
*   **Modified `components/HeroSection.tsx`**:
    *   Updated to call `generateCVContentDirect` by default, making direct frontend calls to the Gemini API the standard behavior.
    *   Ensured `generateCVContentDirect` is imported.
*   **Updated `README.md`**:
    *   Clarified that `generateCVContentDirect` is the default method.
    *   Adjusted instructions for switching to the `generateCVContent` (simulated backend) path for development or testing purposes.
    *   Reinforced API key requirements for the default direct frontend calls.

### Previous Update: Conceptual Codebase Split
*   **Modified `services/geminiService.ts`:**
    *   Retained `generateCVContent` (for simulated backend calls).
    *   Added `generateCVContentDirect` for direct frontend API calls, including Gemini client initialization (expecting `process.env.API_KEY`) and error handling.
*   **Updated `README.md`:**
    *   Added "Conceptual Codebases: Direct API vs. Simulated Backend" section.
    *   Explained the two approaches and functions.
    *   Provided initial (now reversed) instructions for switching in `HeroSection.tsx`.
*   `server/main.js` remains as the commented-out blueprint.

### Initial Setup & Backend Simulation (Older Update)
*   Removed `code.md` Files.
*   Simulated backend for CV generation: `services/geminiService.ts` updated for `fetch` to `/api/cv/generate`; `server/main.js` added (commented out).
*   Introduced `README.md`.
