# AI CV Maker Application

This project is a modern landing page for an AI-powered CV Maker. Users can input a job title or description to get a tailored CV outline generated by AI.

## Key Features

*   AI-powered CV outline generation via a backend service.
*   Responsive design with Tailwind CSS.
*   Interactive UI built with React.
*   **Simulated User Authentication**:
    *   Login/Sign Up with Email/Password.
    *   Simulated "Sign in with Google" and "Sign in with LinkedIn".
    *   Authentication requests are now handled by a simulated backend.
*   Node.js/Express backend (`server/main.js`) to handle API calls securely.

## Architecture Overview

The application exclusively uses a **frontend-backend architecture** for its core CV generation and (simulated) authentication features:

1.  **Frontend (React)**: The user interface built with React. It captures user input for CV generation and authentication, sending requests to the backend.
2.  **Backend (Node.js/Express)**: A Node.js server (`server/main.js`) that:
    *   Receives CV generation requests, calls the Google Gemini API with the necessary API key, and returns the result.
    *   Receives authentication requests, processes them against an in-memory user store (simulation), and returns user data/mock tokens.

This approach ensures API keys are managed securely on the server-side.

## Running the Application

You need to run both the backend server and the frontend development server.

### 1. Backend Server Setup & Run

1.  **Navigate to the project root directory.**
2.  **Install backend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    (This will install `express`, `@google/genai`, `dotenv` from `package.json`.)
3.  **Create an environment file:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the project root directory (next to `package.json` and `server/main.js`).
4.  **Add your API Key to `.env`:**
    Open the `.env` file and add your Google Gemini API key:
    ```
    API_KEY=YOUR_ACTUAL_GEMINI_API_KEY
    ```
    Replace `YOUR_ACTUAL_GEMINI_API_KEY` with your real key. This is for the CV generation feature.
5.  **Start the backend server:**
    ```bash
    node server/main.js
    ```
    The backend server will typically start on `http://localhost:3001`. Check the console output for the exact port.

### 2. Frontend Setup & Run (Assuming Vite or similar dev server)

1.  **Open a new terminal window/tab.**
2.  **Navigate to the project root directory.**
3.  **Install frontend dependencies (if not already done):**
    The `npm install` in the backend setup should cover all dependencies listed in `package.json`.
4.  **Start the frontend development server:**
    If you have a Vite project (common for this setup), run:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will usually start the frontend on `http://localhost:5173` (or another port) and open it in your browser.
    API calls (e.g., `/api/cv/generate`, `/api/auth/*`) require the backend server to be running. A proxy setup (like Vite's dev server provides) is typically used in development to forward these requests to `http://localhost:3001`.

## API Key Management

*   The **Google Gemini API Key (`API_KEY`) is CRUCIAL** for CV generation and is managed **exclusively by the backend server (`server/main.js`)**.
*   It **must** be set in an `.env` file in the project root.
*   The frontend's CV generation logic (`components/HeroSection.tsx`) exclusively calls the backend.

## Authentication (Simulated Backend)

*   The application features a **simulated authentication system** with backend interaction.
*   Users can "Login" or "Sign Up" using the modal. Email/Password, Google, and LinkedIn options make requests to the backend.
*   **Backend Simulation (`server/main.js`):**
    *   Handles requests to `/api/auth/signup`, `/api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/google`, `/api/auth/linkedin`.
    *   Uses an **in-memory array** to store user data. This data is lost when the server restarts.
    *   **Passwords are NOT hashed and are stored directly in memory for this simulation.** This is **EXTREMELY INSECURE** and **NOT for production use.**
    *   Mock JWT tokens are returned.
*   This setup is for demonstrating the frontend-backend authentication flow. **A real application requires a proper database, password hashing (e.g., bcrypt), secure session management, and real OAuth 2.0 integration for social logins.**

## Update Instructions & Changelog

### Simulated Backend Authentication Added
*   **`services/authService.ts` (New):** Frontend service to make API calls to backend auth endpoints.
*   **`components/AuthModal.tsx` (Updated):** Now uses `authService.ts` to interact with the backend for auth.
*   **`server/main.js` (Updated):** Added `/api/auth/*` endpoints and in-memory user store.
*   **`App.tsx` (Updated):** `User` interface updated.

### CV Generation Exclusively Uses Backend
*   **`components/HeroSection.tsx`**: Exclusively calls `generateCVContent` (backend).
*   **`README.md`**: Clarified backend-driven CV generation.
Previous states involved direct frontend API calls for CV generation and UI-only mock authentication.
