  /*
    Regarding "cases letters":
    Google's Material Design often uses:
    - Title Case for app bars, dialog titles.
    - Sentence case or ALL CAPS for buttons (Tailwind default is Sentence case based on content).
    - Sentence case for list items, body text, helper text, etc.
  
    Tailwind CSS does not enforce specific casing globally. The text content's
    natural casing will be preserved, which is generally appropriate and aligns with the request.
    If specific elements need different casing (e.g., all caps buttons),
    Tailwind's `uppercase` class can be used on those specific elements.
    No global text-transform rule is added here to allow flexibility.

  /* For CV Renderer layout - This approach of adding custom utilities to index.css is not standard for Tailwind.
     It's better to configure this in tailwind.config.js if you have one, or use arbitrary values directly in JSX.
     However, for the scope of this file-based update system, it's added here.
